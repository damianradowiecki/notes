Canary deployment is a technique of deploying some new features only to some servers (some users).

At the beginning new feature is deployed to one server to which no user is routed.
Then after some tests some users are routed (5-10% of all users).
Then if everything is ok, one server more is launched and some more users are routed to this server.

At some point all users use new feature, so servers with old functionality are shut down.
