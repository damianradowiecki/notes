Proxy:
CLIENT ---> PROXY SERVER --> SERVER

So client doesn't know server. Client connect to PROXY SERVER. And PROXY SERVER connect to SERVER.
It enables IP anonymity, caching, GeoFencing.

Reverse proxy:
                                  --> SERVER 1
CLIENT ---> REVERSE PROXY SERVER  --> SERVER 2
                                  --> SERVER 3
So client doesn't know to which server it is connected. He connects to REVERSE PROXY SERVER.
REVERSE PROXY SERVER connect to one of SERVERs. 
It enables load balancing, canary deployment and so on.
