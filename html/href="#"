The main use of anchor tags - <a></a> - is as hyperlinks. 
That basically means that they take you somewhere. Hyperlinks require the href property, because it specifies a location.

Hash:
A hash - # within a hyperlink specifies an html element id to which the window should be scrolled.

href="#some-id" would scroll to an element on the current page such as <div id="some-id">.

href="//site.com/#some-id" would go to site.com and scroll to the id on that page.

Scroll to Top:
href="#" doesn't specify an id name, but does have a corresponding location - the top of the page. 
Clicking an anchor with href="#" will move the scroll position to the top.

Block scrolling:
To block scrolling You need to use id which doesn't exists on page for example href="#!".
