&nbsp; - non-breaking space.

It tells an interpreter (browser) to NOT wrap the line so:
Ttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxtttttttttttttttttt&nbsp;ttttteeeexxxxxxxxttttt
will be rendered as one word:
Ttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxtttttttttttttttttt ttttteeeexxxxxxxxttttt
But this:
Ttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxtttttttttttttttttt ttttteeeexxxxxxxxttttt
will be rendered in two lines (when the text will be longer than a screen width):
Ttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxtttttttttttttttttt 
ttttteeeexxxxxxxxttttt


In addition...

This:
<p>Word1          Word2</p>
and this:
<p>Word1 Word2</p>
will render:
Word1 Word2

But this
<p>Word1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word2</p>
will render:
Word1      Word2
