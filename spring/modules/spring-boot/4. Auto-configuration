SPRING BOOT AUTO CONFIGURATION

It is all about using @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation.
If annotation is present it scans classpath for libraries and then guess the best configuration for You.

For example 
If there is no database dependency it creates bean with in memory database configuration.
If there is embedded tomcat it creates configuration for it.
