1. Git is decentralized. SVN is not.
   With Git You have one central repo and many local repos (one for every developer). To commit to/revert changes from Git 
   local repo there is no need of Internet. You can go to Bahamas and commit all changes to local repo, then You go back 
   to your company an merge changes to central repo.
   With SVN You need to have Internet connection all the time for committing or reverting changes.
   
2. Git is more difficult than SVN.
   There is a lot of commands which are sometimes confusing in Git. SVN is much simpler.
