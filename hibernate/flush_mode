org.hibernate.FlushMode

Flushing Modes	Implementation
AUTO	          The Session is sometimes flushed before query execution
COMMIT	        The Session is only flushed prior to a transaction commit
ALWAYS	        The Session is always flushed before query execution
MANUAL	        The Session can only be manually flushed

By default hibernate uses FlushMode.AUTO which means:
The Session is sometimes flushed before query execution in order to ensure that queries never return stale state.
An entity with dirty state must be attached to your session and Hibernate persists it before executing the query.

Changing flush mode:
<property name="org.hibernate.flushMode" value="COMMIT"/>
