Hibernate enables to map class inheritance to database model.
There are three types of inheritance mapping in Hibernate:
-single table (default)
-table per class
-joined

Java Model:
Vehicle:
id
name

TwoWheeler extends Vehicle:
SteeringHandle

FourWheeler:
SteeringWheel

Single table - if every class is marked as entity, there will be one single table created with a discriminator:
dtype | id | name | SteeringHandle | SteeringWheel

dtype - discriminator type - it is used to discriminate types (it is configurable)

Table per class - every entity has its own table in database model.

Joined - it is the most normalized model. For considered class model the following table model will be created:
Vehicle
id | name

TwoWheeler
SteeringHandle | vehicleId

FourWheeler
SteeringWheel | vehicleId
