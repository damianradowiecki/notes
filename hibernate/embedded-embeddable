JPA has @Embedded, @Embeddable, @EmbeddedId annotations.

@Embedded + @Embeddable

Table Person with fields:
id
name
surname
carModel
carVersion

It looks like this table should be divided into two Person and Car.
JPA to the rescue! Person table can be mapped into two classes:

@Entity
class Person
id
name
surname
@Embedded
Car

@Embeddable
class Car
model
version
