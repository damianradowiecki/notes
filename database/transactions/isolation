Transaction isolation types:

READ UNCOMMITTED
It enables dirty reads. So it destroys ACID.

Session 1
START TRANSACTION
INSERT A INTO TABLE_A

Session 2
START TRANSACTION
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->A   <--- dirty read
->1 ROW

Session 1
ROLLBACK
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
-> 0 ROWS



READ COMMITTED
If one transaction commit something, at once in every transaction it is visible.

Session 1
START TRANSACTION
INSERT A INTO TABLE_A

Session 2
START TRANSACTION
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->0 ROWS

Session 1
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->A
->1 ROW
COMMIT


Session 2
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->A   <--- dirty read
->1 ROW
COMMIT



REPEATABLE READ
If one transaction commit something, changes are not visible for transactions
which were started before commit.

Session 1
START TRANSACTION
INSERT A INTO TABLE_A

Session 2
START TRANSACTION
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->0 ROWS

Session 1
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->A
->1 ROW
COMMIT

Session 2
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A
->0 ROWS
COMMIT <-- transaction closed
SELECT * FROM TABLE_A 
->A
->1 ROW

SERIALIZABLE
