GENARALLY
Git by default does not keep history when you change filename (doesn't matter if you use mv or git mv or do it manually).

GIT TRICK TO FIND RENAMED FILES HISTORY
But if you only rename a file, then Git is able to find out that the file was only renamed (compares files content).
To see a renamed file full history use:
git log --follow ./path/to/file


RENAMING A FILE AND CHANGING ITS CONTENT - HOW NOT TO LOSE HISTORY?
To keep history of a file when you are going to rename it and change its content you must: put it in two separate commits:
1. First commit contains only a file name change
2. Second commit contains all files changes
REMEMBER NOT TO SQUASH COMMITS
