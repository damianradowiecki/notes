WebSocket - is a protocol which provides full-duplex communication (unlike HTTP). WebSocket addresses
  start with ws (websocket) or with wss (websocket secure) prefix. Generally it is based on listeners
  on both sides.

JavaScript example:

//this opens a connection
let socket = new WebSocket("wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello");

//connection listeners
socket.onopen = function(e) {};
socket.onmessage = function(event) {};
socket.onclose = function(event) {};
socket.onerror = function(error) {};

//sending data to server
socket.send("any data");

Connection starts with HTTP handshake request from client with Upgrade header:
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com

And server response is:
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
