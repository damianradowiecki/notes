POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3. It is used to access emails from an email server. 
    By default when you download any email (from server) it is deleted on remote machine 
    and saved on local machine. So when you then check your email folders on other machine
    there are no emails which you have seen on first computer.
    Of course it is possible to change the default behaviour. But all email clients
    (programms which uses the same email) must change this behaviour.
    
    It is not encrypted connection protocol.
    Default port is 110.

POP3S is encrypted version of POP3.
    Default port is 995.
