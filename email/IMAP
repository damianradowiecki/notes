IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol. It is used to access emails from an email server.
  IMAP enables many clients to work with one email account, by keeping emails on a remote server
  (not on local machine, like POP3 works by default). It is now recommended protocol for
  message accessing.
  
  It is worth to mention that it is not a secure connection (not encrypted).

  Default port is 143.
