In order to make an virtual Network Interface Card mark Enable Network Adapter.
Then there are some modes to choose:
Not Attached - it means that virtual NIC exists but there is no connection to any network.
NAT - it works like there would be an router in VirtualBox (remember: virtual boxi is just an apllication) which uses NAT. 
    There is just a virtual router. A router in Virtual Box uses NAT (Network Address Translation). The virtual machine 
    is invisible and unreachable from the outside internet. From outside internet there is only way to request virtual 
    box application.
NAT Network - is the same like NAT hovewer all virtual machines are in the same one network - they can see each other.
Bridged Network - it behaves like a normal computer in a network. It has its own IP address.
Host-only network - only host (which runs virtual machine) can connect to virtual machines.
    And virtual machines can communicate with each other.
Internal network - all virtual machines are in one networki without access to host.
