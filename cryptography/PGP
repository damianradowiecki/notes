PGP - pretty good privacy - it is a utility used to encrypt emails. It was an open-source product for almost every
    operating system.
    The utility lets: 
    -encrypt and decrypt messages
    -make a cipher sign
    -verify sender authenticity
    -manage keys (public,private)
    
    At some point (version 5.0) it became a comercial product for all operating systems except unix based ones.
    So then arose a new standard OpenPGP and a new open-source product - GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).
