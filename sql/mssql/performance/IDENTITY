IDENTITY is a way to autoincrement values for. For example:

create table Test
(
id INT IDENTITY, 
name VARCHAR(20)
)

IDENTITY == INDENTITY(1,1)
So it will start from 1 and will be increased by 1

create table Test
(
id INT IDENTITY(2,3), 
name VARCHAR(20)
)

IDENTITY(2,3)
So it will start from 2 and will be increased by 3

How to use IDENTITY:
insert values('Damian') into Test;
insert values('Andrzej') into Test;
Just ommit a column with IDENTITY function.

If there is IDENTITY function on table we cannot insert something directly.
We must set identity insert:
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Test ON
And then switch it off:
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Test OFF

To check current value for identity for a particular table:
SELECT IDENT_CURRENT(table_name)


From MSSQL Server 2012 sequences are available.
