CAP threorem says that in distributed DATABASE systems only two of: 
  Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance can be guaranteed.

Consistency - every node has the same data at any time.
Availability - system works 100% well, event if any node fails.
Partition Tolerance - system still works, even if there are communication problems between nodes.
