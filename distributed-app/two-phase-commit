In distributed applications there is a need to provide transaction managment over all apps.
So there is a concept called two phase commit:

Transaction manager:                  Apps:
      -------Prepare for commit -------> 
      <------Ready or Not---------------
      -------Commit or rollback ------->
      <------Done or Not ---------------
      
So at the beginning the transaction manager sends to all apps prepare for commit command.
If all return that they are raedy, so then commit command is sent. If any of apps return
Not ready state all transaction is rolled back (rollback command is sent to all apps).
After Commit command there is possibility that not every app commit will happen, so
then there are different recovery strategies.

Why TWO phase commit?
Because there are two phases:
1. Preparing for commit
2. Commit
