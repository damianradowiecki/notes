User thread:
Thread thread = new Thread(...);
thread.start();

Daemon thread:
Thread thread = new Thread(...);
thread.setDaemon(true);
thread.start();

JVM ends when last USER THREAD ends its work -> all daemon threads are killed immediately (after last user thread ends).

So daemon thread should not be used to do business logic.

Daemon threads are used for example by garbage collector.
