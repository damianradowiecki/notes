There are two types of threads in Java: User and Daemon.

User threads have high priority and program can't finish until all user threads are working.
New Thread by default is a user thread.

Daemon threads run in background, which means that they have low priority. Even if there are no user threads running and
  daemon threads run a program will finish its execution.
