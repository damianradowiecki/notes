From JLS:

If the value p being boxed is true, false, a byte, or a char in the range \u0000 to \u007f, 
or an int or short number between -128 and 127 (inclusive), 
then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions 
of p. It is always the case that r1 == r2.

It is just an optimalization (to have less references in a heap).

It simply means that:
Integer a = 127;
Integer b = 127;
Integer c = 128;
Integer d = 128;

System.out.println(a==b); --> true
System.out.println(c==d); --> false
