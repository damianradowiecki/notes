Classloader - loads classes to JVM.

There are four possible classloaders:
1. Bootstrap classloader - main (act as a first) class loader, loads classes from $JAVA_HOME/lib/*.jar
2. Extension classloader - loads additional classes from $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext/*.jar
3. System classloader - loads classes from classpath (described in CLASSPATH variable)
4. Custom classloader - classloader created by a user.


Class names conflict.
If there are two classes with the same name: com.a.b.Test and com.a.b.Test, then only the first will be loaded.


Hierarchism
If any classloader can't find requested class, then it ask its parent if he has this class,
and it goes recursively up to Bootstrap. If any of classloader couldn't find class, then
the classloader (which initiated this mechanizm) tries to load the requested class.


ClassNotFoundException vs NoClassDefFoundError
ClassNotFoundException - is raised when classloader couldn't find a requested class.
NoClassDefFoundError - is raised when there were problems with loading a requested class.
