String.length
It check how many signs there is in a string.

String.getBytes().length
It check how many bytes are used to keep it in memory. For example if UTF-8 encoding is used,
then string like this:
dół
will result in:
"dół".length -> 3
"dół.getBytes("UTF-8").length -> 5 (polish letters need two bytes in UTF-8 encoding)
