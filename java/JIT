JVM steps:
0. Creating java files (*.java).
1. Compiling java files (*.java) to byte code (*.class), using javac command.
2. Running java code (with java command). JVM executes byte code directly.
3. If some code is used repetedly JIT (Just In Time) compiler translates it to machine code to be able to execute it faster.
