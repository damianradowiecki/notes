Naming service - service which runs on a server and can keep objects. 
  You can put them to or retrieve them from service (by name).

Directory service - service which runs on a server and can keep objects. 
  You can put them to or retrieve them from service (by name). (A little bit different API in comparison to naming service).


JNDI - Java Naming And Directory Interface. It is the common interface for naming and directory services.
  It is based on Context interface, which are implemented by JNDI vendors:

public interface Context {
  
    public Object lookup(String name) throws NamingException;
    public void bind(String name, Object obj) throws NamingException;
    public void unbind(String name) throws NamingException;

    // and a lot of other methods...

};

Popular Context implementation: InitialContext, InitialDirContext (for directory services), InitialLdapContext.

How to run/use:
1. Run server which has JNDI service.
2. Run client code. Example:
  public class JNDI {
	  public static void main(String[] args) throws NamingException {
      //connects to JNDI service on default IP and port
		  Context context = new InitialContext();
      //puts something to service
		  context.bind("test", "Something");
      //gets something by name
		  String result = (String)context.lookup("test");
      //prints result
		  System.out.println(result);
	  }
  }
