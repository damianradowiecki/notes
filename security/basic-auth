Basic auth is about login and password.
So if user wants to authorize using basic auth, he must add header Authorization with value:
    
                              Basic + base64(user+password)
                              
So example request with Authentication header:
GET /users HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: localhost:8080\r\n
Authorization: Basic ZGFtaWFuOjEyMzQ1\r\n
