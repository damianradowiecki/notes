Its about extending existing class.

(from www.w3schools.com)
Prototype Inheritance
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

Example:

//Defining class
function Person(name, surname){

  this.name = name;
  this.surname = surname;

  this.changeName = function(name){
    this.name = name;
  };

}

//So if Person inherits from Person.prototype we can:
Person.prototype.fullName = function(){
  return this.name + this.surname;
};

//So we can use it:
var damian = new Person("Damian", "Radowiecki");
alert(damian.fullName());
