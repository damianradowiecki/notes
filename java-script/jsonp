JSONP - JSON with Padding

JSONP lets download data from server omitting cross-domain request limits.
By requesting script it is possible to omit cross-domain policy (script src doesn't follow cross-domain policy).

1. Create JS function which will be invoked (by script added from service):

  function test(dataFromServer){
    //code
  }
  
2. Create service which will return our method call with arguments:

  //service should return
  test('some data which is needed in front end');
  
3. Include in script tag reference to service:
  
  //it will fire test function in java script
  <script src="testCall.php">
