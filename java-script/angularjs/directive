var myModule = angular.module(...);

myModule.directive('drButton', function factory(injectables){

  var directiveDefinitionObject = {
    restrict: ...,
    priority: ...,
    ...
  
  }
  
  return directiveDefinitionObject;
}

Directive options:
-restrict - states how a directive can be used, default is 'A' - attribute only (E - as element, A - attribute, C - css class, M - comment)
-priority - the higher priority the sooner it will be applied (it is used when elements are next to each other)
-template - is a textual definition of a template ('<div> aaa</div>...')
-templateUrl - it is a link to a template
-transclude - enables to keep the content inside directive (ng-transclude directive says where should the content be put),
              a good explanation is here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24725399/what-is-ng-transclude
-compile - it is a function with the following prototype: function compile(element, attrs, transclude){...}
          the function is run during compilation phase - transforming DOM - the function is run only once.
-link - it is a function with the following prototype: function compile(scope, element, attrs){...}
          the function is run during linking phase - links element with model (scope) - the function is run once per every directive element in DOM.
