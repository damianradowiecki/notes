Git stores versions as snapshots
SVN stores versions as deltas

Snapshot - it is just a hard copy of all files at a given time - it needs more memory
Delta - it is a difference between files - it needs less memory

Git snapshots - does not copy all files at every version - it only copies the changed ones and the references to the others (not changed)
