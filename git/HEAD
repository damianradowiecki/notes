HEAD - is a pointer to your current revision. In other words, HEAD answers the question, “Where am I right now?”. 
        Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. 

Detachet HEAD - it is a situation when the HEAD pointer does not point on the last revision in branch, but any of previous ones.

How to go back to your branch?

git checkout branch_name
