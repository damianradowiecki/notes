git diff vs git diff --staged
  git diff            shows changes between unstaged area and staged area
  git diff --staged   shows changes between staged area and last commited version (--cached can be used instead - it is a synonym for --staged)
  
git rm FILE - removes a file from git database AND FROM WORKSPACE

git rm --cached FILE - removes a file from git database only (the file stays in workspace)

git reset HEAD filename  -  removes a file from staging area (--hard option reset file in a working space)
git restore --staged filename - the same as above (works from Git 2.23.0 onwards)

git checkout -- filename  -  unmodifies a file, it resets changes in a working space to last commit
git restore filename - the same as above (works from Git 2.23.0 onwards)
