Let's say we have the following situation (I want to merge branch B to branch A):
git checkout A
git merge B

Strategies:
fast forward - happens when there are no other changes on branch A since they diverged, so then Git just moves the A branch pointer at the end of branch B - goes forward,
      there is no additional commits here
      
three-way merge - is a default in Git and is used when some work has been done on A and B branches since diverging. In this kind of merge three revisions are
      taken into account:
      -last revision from A branch
      -last revision from B branch
      -common ancestor
      As a result of three way merge a new revision (commit) is created.
