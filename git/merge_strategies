Let's say we have the following situation (I want to merge branch B to branch A):
git checkout A
git merge B

Strategies:
fast forward - is happens when there are no other changes on branch A since they diverged, so then Git just moves the A branch pointer at the end of branch B - goes forward,
      there is no additional commits here
