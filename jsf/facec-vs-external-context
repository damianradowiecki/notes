FacesContext - is context specific to JSF framework: components, validators...

ExternalContext - offers access to Servlet or Portlet-specific artifacts which JSF is currently using "under the covers".
    So it is possible to operate directly on objects like: 
      HTTP servlet request, HTTP servlet response, HTTP session, Servlet context
